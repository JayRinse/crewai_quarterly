The Investment \\nManager will seek to achieve the Fund’s objective by making substantially all of the investments \\n(“Investments ”) of the Fund in pan -African private and sovereign debt instruments. The Fund aims \\nto deliver a return of 10 -15% in U.S. dollars. The Fund will invest in fixed income securities across \\nAfrican markets, including, but not limited to: local currency sovereign and corporate debt; U.S. \\ndollar - and Euro -denominated fixed income securities; short -term, liquid deb t; certificate of deposit \\naccounts; foreign exchange market forwards; structured debt; collateralized short -term debt; \\nconvertible debt; floating -rate notes; repos; reverse repos; swaps; futures; and, options.   \\nThe Investment Manager believes that the Fund  offers investors a unique opportunity to take \\nadvantage of favourable developments in African economies and capital markets. This trend is the \\nresult of a favourable global macroeconomic environment essentially driven by debt relief \\ninitiatives, higher co mmodity prices and to some extent, improving political governance. Africa is \\nbecoming an attractive investment destination generating high returns, yet its capital markets \\nremain fairly underdeveloped. In a context of globalised world economy , risk appetit e is increasing  \\nand expanding the traditional investment frontiers. There can be no assurance, however, that this \\nstate of affairs will continue.  \\nBy focusing on these markets and actively managing the debt portfolio of the Fund, the Investment \\nManager beli eves it will be well positioned to take advantage of its deep understanding of the local \\ninvestment processes.  \\nInvestment Limitations  \\nBorrowing of Cash and Securities and Certain Loans  \\nBorrowings . The Fund is authorized to borrow for Investment purposes or to fund redemption \\nrequests. Loans generally may be obtained from securities brokers and dealers or from other \\nfinancial institutions. Such loans will be secured by securities or other capital of the Fund pledged \\nto such brokers or financial in stitutions.  \\nShort Sales . The Fund anticipates engaging in “short sales” as part of its investment strategy. Short \\nselling is the practice of selling securities that are borrowed from a third party. The Fund will be \\nrequired to return securities equivalent to those borrowed for the short sale at the lender's demand. \\nPending the return of such securities, the Fund will be required to deposit with the lender as \\ncollateral the proceeds of the short sale plus additional cash or securities. The amount of the \\nrequired deposit will be adjusted periodically to reflect any change in the market price of the \\nsecurities that the Fund is required to return to the lender.  \\nThe Fund will be required to pay brokerage commissions to execute short sales and may be required \\nto pay a premium to the lender of the securities, which would increase the cost of the securities\"),\n",

The Fund, without limitation, may hold cash \\nor invest in cash equivalents for short -term Investments. Among the cash equivalents in which the \\nFund may invest are: obligations of the  U.S. Government, obligations of governments within the \\nEuropean Union and their agencies or instrumentalities (US and EU Government Securities,  U.S. \\nTreasury Bills  and EU equivalents, or any AA rated securities in each currency); commercial paper; \\nauction rate preferred shares; and repurchase agreements, money market mutual funds, certificates \\nof deposit and bankers' acceptances issued by domestic branches of  U.S. banks that are members of \\nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. In the event the Investment Manager determines that \\nthere is not sufficiently good value in any securities suitable for Investment of the Fund's capital, all \\nsuch capital may be held in ca sh and cash equivalents.  \\nIn making investment decisions, the Fund will rely on the advice of the Investment Manager rather \\nthan any specific objective criteria.  \\nThe foregoing description is general and is not intended to be exhaustive. Investors must recog nize \\nthat there are inherent limitations on all descriptions of investment processes due to the complexity, \\nconfidentiality and subjectivity of such processes. In addition, the description of virtually every \\nstrategy must be qualified by the fact that inve stment approaches are continually changing, as are \\nthe markets invested in by the Fund.

In the case where the Deemed Tax Credit is utilized , the effective tax rate \\npayable by the Fund on the taxable profits may be reduced to a maximum of 3%.   \\nThe Mauritius Finance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2018 has brought changes to certain \\nprovisions i n the Mauritius Income Tax Act 1995. With effect  from 1 January 2019 , the Deemed \\nTax Credit has been phased out, through the implementation of a new tax regime. Companies which \\nhad obtained their GBL on or before 16 October 2017, including the Fund, have b een grandfathered \\nand would benefit from the Deemed Tax Credit regime up to 30 June 2021.  Accordingly, the Fund \\nis entitled to a foreign tax credit equivalent to the higher of the actual tax suffered or 80% Deemed \\nTax Credit on its foreign source income, u p to 30 June 2021.  \\nPost June 30, 2021, under the new tax regime and subject to meeting the necessary substance \\nrequirements as required under the Financial Services Act 2007 (as amended by the Finance Act \\n2018) and such guidelines issued by the FSC, the F und is entitled to either (a) a foreign tax credit \\nequivalent to the actual foreign tax suffered on its foreign income against the Fund’s tax liability \\ncomputed at 15% on such income, or (b) an exemption of 80% on some of the specified income \\nderived inclu ding but not limited to foreign source dividends or interest income subject to meeting \\ncertain prescribed conditions.  \\nFollowing the Finance Act 2018, the Partial Exemption Regime (the “ Partial Exemption ”) has \\nbeen introduced whereby it provides 80% exempti on on specified income which amongst others \\nincludes income derived by a collective investment scheme (CIS) provided the company satisfies \\nthe conditions relating to the substance of its activities. The Partial Exemption Regime is available \\nto all companie s resident in Mauritius.  \\nUnder the Partial Exemption, the Fund, provided that it satisfies the conditions relating to the \\nsubstance of its activities as prescribed in the Income Tax Regulations 1996, will be able to benefit \\nfrom an income tax exemption at the rate of 80% on all of its foreign -sourced income by virtue of it \\nbeing a collective investment scheme. The remaining 20% of the foreign -sourced income of the Fund \\nwill be taxed at a rate 15%.  \\nMauritius does not have any capital gains tax regime. Furthermore, any profit derived from the sale \\nof securities is specifically exempt from tax.  \\nThe Fund is resident in Mauritius on the basis that it is incorporated in Mauritius and has its central \\nmanagement and control in Mauritius.

This summary is general, and may not apply to all categories of investors, some of which may \\nbe subject to special rules (e.g., banks, thrifts, insurance companies, and dealers and other investors \\nthat do not own their Shares as capital assets). The actual tax and financial consequences of the \\npurchase and ownership of Shares will vary depending upon the investor’s particular circumstance s. \\nThis summary is based on the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”), the \\nregulations (“ Treasury Regulations ”) promulgated thereunder, court decisions and published rulings \\nof the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (the “ IRS”) currently i n effect and does not take into account the \\npossible effect of future legislative or administrative changes or court decisions. It is not intended as \\na complete analysis of all possible tax considerations relevant to acquiring, holding, or disposing of \\nShares. The Fund will not request any rulings from the IRS on the tax consequences described below \\nor on any other issues. The IRS or a court might reach a contrary conclusion with respect to the issues \\naddressed herein if the matter were contested. Future le gislative or administrative changes or court \\ndecisions may significantly change the conclusions expressed herein, and any such changes or \\ndecisions may have a retroactive effect with respect to the transactions contemplated herein. In \\naddition, except as o therwise explicitly stated herein, the summary does not consider state, local, or \\nforeign tax issues.  \\nU.S. Tax Classification Issues  \\nFund Classification  \\nThe Fund will make an election to be classified as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes \\nunder the “check the box” rules of Section 301.7701 -3 of the Treasury Regulations relating to entity \\nclassification. As a result, under current law, the F und intends to be classified and treated as a partnership \\nfor U.S. federal income tax purposes and not as an association or “publicly traded partnership” taxable \\nas a corporation. However, the Fund could fail to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal  income tax \\npurposes in future years as a result of a variety of developments including, without limitation, \\ncharacterization of the Fund as a publicly traded partnership as a result of the volume and nature of \\ncontributions and redemptions of capital and transfers of the Shares. A publicly traded partnership is any \\npartnership the interests of which are traded on an established securities market or which are readily \\ntradable on a secondary market (or the substantial equivalent thereof). The Shares will not  be traded on \\nan established securities market, and Treasury Regulations pertaining to publicly traded partnerships \\nprovide certain safe harbors under which interests in a partnership will not be considered readily tradable \\non a secondary market (or the su bstantial equivalent thereof), which the Fund expects to qualify for so \\nas not to be classified as a publicly traded partnership, although no assurance can be provided in this \\nregard.  \\nFailure to qualify as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes  could result in the Fund being \\ntreated as a corporation. If the Fund were determined to be taxable as a corporation, the Fund could be \\nclassified as a passive foreign investment corporation or a controlled foreign corporation with adverse U.S. \\nfederal inc ome tax consequences to certain investors. In particular, investors would not be entitled to report \\nlosses realized by the Fund and would not be entitled to claim as a credit any of the foreign'),\n",

Each U.S. Partner (as \\ndefined below) will be required to report its allocable share (whether or not any distributions  are made) \\nof the Fund’s items of income, gain, loss, deduction, and credit for each taxable year of the Fund ending \\nwith or within the U.S. Partner’s taxable year. It is possible that in a given year an investor may be \\nallocated income or gain that will b e subject to U.S. federal income tax in an amount that exceeds the \\namount of cash (if any) distributed by the Fund to such investor, thus requiring such investor to use \\npersonal funds to pay any tax liabilities arising from such allocation.  \\nU.S. Partners  \\nThe following discussion describes consequences to U.S. Partners in the Fund. For this purpose, a “U.S. \\nPartner” means any person or entity that is (i) a citizen or resident of the United States, (ii) a corporation \\nor other entity taxable as a corporation c reated or organized in or under the laws of the United States \\nor any political subdivision of the United States, (iii) an estate the income of which is subject to U.S. \\nfederal income taxation regardless of its source, or (iv) a trust if a U.S. court is abl e to exercise primary \\nsupervision over the administration of the trust and one or more U.S. persons have the authority to \\ncontrol all substantial decisions of the trust or if the trust has validly made an election to be treated as \\na U.S. person under appli cable Treasury Regulations.  \\nFor U.S. federal income tax purposes, income earned through a foreign or domestic partnership or other \\nflow-through entity is attributed to its owners. If a partnership or other flow -through entity holds a \\npartnership interest, the U.S. federal income tax treatment of the holder will generally depend on the \\nstatus of the partner or other owner and the activities of the partnership or other flow -through entity.  \\nNon-corporate U.S. Partners (and certain closely -held personal service  and S corporations) are subject to \\ncertain limitations on using losses from “passive business activities” to offset business income, salary \\nincome, and portfolio income (including, without limitation, interest, dividends, capital gains from \\nportfolio inve stments, and royalties). The Fund is expected to be considered a “passive activity” for \\npurposes of these rules. Interest on any amount borrowed by a U.S. Partner subject to these rules that is \\nused to purchase Shares in the Fund generally will be treated as a “passive activity” expense and will be \\nsubject to the limitations on deductibility applicable to “passive activity” expenses. In general, such \\ninterest will be deductible only to the extent of the taxpayer’s income from “passive activities” (including  \\nboth its investment in the Fund and other “passive activity” investments of the taxpayer). These rules also \\nwould limit the ability of U.S. Partners subject to the rules to deduct any losses that are allocable to them \\nfrom the Fund. “Passive activity” exp enses and losses which are not deductible in the year incurred, \\nhowever, may be carried forward and deducted in a future year in which the investor has sufficient \\n“passive activity” income (either from the Fund or from other investments that are passive ac tivities) or \\nwhen the property generating the losses is sold.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 32}, page_content='23 \\n In addition to the foregoing limitation, a U.S. Partner may not deduct from taxable income its share of \\nthe losses of the Fund, if any, to the extent that such losses exceed the lesser of (i) th e adjusted tax basis \\nof its Shares at the end of the Fund’s taxable year in which the loss occurs, and (ii) in the case of certain \\nU.S. Partners, the amount for which such investor is considered “at risk” at the end of that year. In \\ngeneral, a U.S. Partner  will initially be “at risk” to the extent of the amount of cash and the adjusted \\nbases in the other assets, if any, the U.S. Partner is deemed to have contributed to the Fund (unless it \\nborrowed amounts on a nonrecourse basis to acquire or carry its Share s), plus its share of the Fund’s \\nliabilities that are considered “qualified nonrecourse financing” for purposes of the “at risk” rules. A \\nU.S. Partner’s “at risk” amount will increase or decrease as the adjusted basis in its interest increases or \\ndecreases . Losses disallowed to a U.S. Partner as a result of these rules can be carried forward and may \\nbe available to such U.S. Partner to offset gain from the same activity or may be utilized to the extent \\nthat the U.S. Partner’s adjusted basis or “at risk” amo unt (whichever was the limiting factor) is increased \\nin a subsequent year. The “at risk” rules apply to a U.S. Partner, an individual shareholder of a corporate \\nU.S. Partner that is an S corporation, and a corporate U.S. Partner if fifty percent (50%) or m ore of the \\nvalue of stock of such corporate U.S. Partner is owned directly or indirectly by five or fewer individuals \\nat any time during the last half of the taxable year.  \\nCash Distributions and Redemptions  \\nThe receipt of a distribution from the Fund by an investor generally will not result in the recognition of \\ngain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, distributions of cash in excess of an \\ninvestor’s adjusted basis for its Shares will result in the recognition of gain in the amount of s uch excess. \\nFor purposes of these rules, a decrease in the investor’s share of Fund liabilities (which can result from \\na variety of types of transactions) is treated as if it were a distribution of cash.  \\nAn investor’s adjusted basis in its Shares will init ially equal the amount of any initial cash contribution, \\nadjusted to reflect the investor’s share of any Fund liabilities. The basis will be increased by the investor’s \\nadditional cash contributions, its distributive share of Fund income, and any increase in the investor’s \\nshare of Fund liabilities. The basis will be decreased (but not below zero) by the amount of cash \\ndistributions, the adjusted basis of any property distributed from the Fund, the investor’s distributive share \\nof Fund losses, and any decre ase in the investor’s share of Fund liabilities.  \\nNo gain will be recognized by an investor with respect to distributions made to it in liquidation of its \\ninterest in the Fund unless the amount of cash distributed exceeds its adjusted basis for its Shares \\nimmediately before the distribution (including adjustments reflecting operations in the year of \\ndissolution). No loss may be recognized by an investor with respect to liquidating distributions unless \\nthe property distributed consists solely of cash and then  only to the extent that the amount of the cash \\nis less than the investor’s adjusted basis in its Shares. The basis of any property received by an investor \\nin liquidation of its interest in the Fund generally will be equal to the adjusted basis of its shar es less \\nthe amount of any cash received in the liquidation.  \\n \\n \\nU.S. Foreign Tax Credit Considerations'),\n",

Such taxes will be allocated to investors and may, under U.S. federal income tax \\nlaw, be eligible for the foreign tax credit, subject to applicable limitations.  \\nU.S. persons should note that the United States may have different rules for determining the amount and, \\nespeciall y, the timing of items of income, gain, loss, and deduction than jurisdictions in which the Fund \\nis viewed as generating income. Accordingly, income as determined for U.S. purposes in the hands of \\nan investor may be recognized in an earlier or later year t han such income is recognized and subject to \\ntax under the laws of the other jurisdiction. Otherwise creditable foreign income taxes can be carried \\nback by an investor to the year preceding the year in which the Fund paid or accrued such taxes but not \\nto an earlier year. Accordingly, an investor could lose the benefits of the U.S. foreign tax credit with \\nrespect to taxes that were paid or accrued to a non -U.S. jurisdiction more than one year after the year in \\nwhich the corresponding income was recognized by  the investor for U.S. federal income tax purposes. \\nThe ability of a U.S. Partner to claim a U.S. foreign tax credit for any non -U.S. income taxes incurred \\nby the Fund will be material to such investor’s after -tax economic return from an investment in the Fund, \\nand U.S. Partners who are considering an investment in the Fund should consult their advisors as to the \\navailability of this credit given such person’s unique circumstances.  \\nU.S. Taxation of Dispositions of the Shares by U.S. Taxable Investors  \\nIf Sha res are sold, transferred, or otherwise disposed of, gain or loss from the disposition will be based \\non the difference between the amount realized on the disposition and the adjusted basis attributable to \\nthe Shares that are disposed of. The amount realize d on the disposition of Shares generally will equal \\nthe sum of (i) any cash received, (ii) the fair market value of any other property received, and (iii) the \\namount of the Fund’s liabilities allocated to the Shares. Because the amount realized includes an y \\namount attributable to the relief from the Fund’s liabilities attributable to the Shares, a U.S. Partner could \\nhave taxable income, or perhaps even a tax liability, in excess of the amount of cash and property \\nreceived upon the disposition of the Shares.  An investor generally will recognize capital gain or loss on \\nthe sale of Shares except to the extent of any gain attributable to the Fund’s unrealized receivables or \\ninventory items, if any.  \\nU.S. Taxation of the Fund’s Operations for U.S. Tax -Exempt Inves tors \\nOrganizations exempt from U.S. federal income tax under Section 501(a) of the Code, including ERISA \\nplans and certain other investors, are subject to tax on unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). UBTI \\narises primarily as income from an unrelated trade or business regularly carried on (including an unrelated \\ntrade or business regularly carried on by a partnership of which the entity is a partner) or as income from \\nproperty as to which there is or has been acquisition indebtedness (including gain fr om the sale of such \\ndebt-financed property). Tax -exempt entities may be restricted in their ability to offset losses from one \\nunrelated trade or business against the income of another unrelated trade or business (even if those trades \\nor businesses are both  conducted by the Fund). Passive income that constitutes dividends, interest, \\nroyalties, or capital gains generally are not UBTI; however, these types of income can become UBTI if \\nthey are generated by “debt -financed property.” “Debt -financed property” gen erally means any property \\nheld for the production of income with respect to which there is “acquisition indebtedness.” “Acquisition \\nindebtedness” with respect to property generally means indebtedness incurred in connection with the \\nacquisition or improveme nt of such property. Leverage incurred by the Fund used to acquire investments \\nand treated as acquisition indebtedness will be attributed to tax -exempt investors in the Fund. Accordingly, \\ntax-exempt investors may recognize substantial UBTI as a result of a n investment in the Fund. Moreover,'),\n",

Accordingly, any tax -exempt investor considering \\nan investme nt in the Fund must consult its own tax adviser regarding the tax consequences of investing in \\nthe Fund.  \\nU.S. Taxation of the Fund’s Operations for Non -U.S. Investors  \\nSpecial tax considerations apply to investors that are foreign taxpayers for U.S. tax purposes, such as non -\\nresident aliens, foreign corporations, foreign institutional investors, and foreign trusts and estates, in each \\ncase that are not otherwise carrying on a trade or business in the United States (“ Non-U.S. Partners ”). \\nThe tax treatment to a Non -U.S. Partner will depend on whether the Fund is engaged in a U.S. trade or \\nbusiness, or if the Fund has a permanent establishment in the United States if a tax treaty applies with \\nrespect to such Non -U.S. Partner, and whether the income from the F und is effectively connected with \\nthe conduct of such trade or business, or is allocable to such permanent establishment under an applicable \\ntax treaty (“ Effectively Connected Income ”). A Non -U.S. Partner will be required to file a U.S. tax \\nreturn on an an nual basis as a result of recognizing Effectively Connected Income, and its allocable share \\nof net Effectively Connected Income will be subject to U.S. federal income tax. A U.S. foreign tax credit \\nmay be available to a Non -U.S. Partner who is deemed to re ceive Effectively Connected Income from \\nthe Fund’s operations. Absent a reduction or exemption pursuant to an applicable tax treaty, a corporate \\nNon-U.S. Partner that is treated as engaged in a U.S. trade or business may be subject to an additional \\nbranch profits tax at a flat rate of 30% in respect of certain amounts in addition to the full tax at graduated \\nrates imposed on its net Effectively Connected Income.  \\nThe Fund should not have Effectively Connected Income because it should not have a U.S. trade or  \\nbusiness, or a permanent establishment, and even if it did, the income will be almost entirely from \\nsources without the United States and will not be described within certain specified categories, and the \\nFund will have an office outside the United States  that will constitute a material factor in the generation \\nof such income.  \\nOther U.S. Tax Compliance Considerations  \\nPartnership Tax Return; Decision -Making Authority; Audits  \\nGenerally, the Fund does not expect to file a U.S. tax return because it should not  have gross income \\neffectively connected with a U.S. trade or business or income from U.S. sources. However, the Fund \\nwill provide sufficient information to investors so that the investors can comply with their own tax \\nfiling obligations.  \\nIf the Fund does file a U.S. tax return, the Directors will have considerable authority to make decisions \\naffecting the tax treatment and procedural rights of the investors. For example, it will decide how to report \\nthe Fund’s items on its tax returns if it files such  returns, and investors are required by the Code to treat \\nsuch items consistently on their own U.S. federal income tax return unless they file a statement with the \\nIRS disclosing the inconsistency. In addition, the Directors will have the right on behalf o f all investors \\nto extend the statute of limitations with respect to the investors’ tax liability on Fund items.  \\nThe tax treatment of items of gain, income, loss, deductions, and credit generally will be determined at the \\nFund level in a single proceeding rather than by individual audits of the investors. An audit of the Fund \\nmay result in the disallowance, reallocation, or deferral of losses or deductions claimed by the Fund and/or \\nthe acceleration or reallocation of income of the Fund. The audit may also result in transactions that the'),\n",

Any such change may cause an investor \\nto be required  to pay additional tax (including penalties and interest), or, i n certain circumstances, absent \\nan election by the Fund to the contrary, any such change resulting in additional U.S. federal income \\ntaxes (including penalties and interest) may be imposed on the Fund directly, which could cause the \\neconomic burden of these additional U.S. federal income tax liabilities arising on audit of the Fund to \\nbe borne by Shareholders based on their interests in the Fund in the year during which the audit or other \\nproceeding is resolved, even though liabilities are attributable to an earlier taxable year in which the \\ninterests or identity of some or all of the investors was different.  \\nForm 8865 Reporting  \\nA U.S. person may be required to file an information ret urn with respect to the ownership of the Shares \\nunder one or more of several circumstances. Such a return may be required for a taxable year during \\nwhich a U.S. person acquires or disposes of an interest in a foreign partnership or the person’s \\nproportiona l interest in the partnership changes substantially. An information return is also required if \\na U.S. person either (1) is a “controlling fifty -percent partner” of a foreign partnership or (2) holds an \\ninterest of at least 10% in the partnership while the partnership is controlled by U.S. persons with 10% \\nor greater interests. Finally, a U.S. person may be required to file an information return reporting \\ntransfers to a foreign partnership. The IRS has prescribed one form, Form 8865 (Return of U.S. Person \\nWith Respect To Certain Foreign Partnerships), for all of these returns. The form is filed with, and due \\nat the same time as, the filer’s U.S. federal income tax return for the year.  \\nU.S. State and Local Taxes  \\nIn addition to the U.S. federal income tax conse quences described above, prospective investors should \\nconsider potential state and local tax consequences of an investment in the Fund. State and local laws \\noften differ from federal income tax laws with respect to the treatment of specific items of income , \\ngain, loss, deduction, and credit. An investor’s allocable share of the taxable income or loss of the Fund \\ngenerally will be required to be included in determining its reportable income for state and local tax \\npurposes in the jurisdiction in which such i nvestor is subject to taxation. Prospective tax -exempt \\ninvestors should also be aware that the rules of some states and localities for computing and/or reporting \\nUBTI may differ from the U.S. federal rules.'),\n",

This Memorandum was written to support the promotion or marketing of the Fund.  \\nThe U.S. Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ ERISA ”), governs the \\ninvestment of the assets of certain employee benefit plans that may  be limited partners. ERISA and \\nthe rules and regulations of the  U.S. Department of Labor (“ DOL ”) under ERISA contain provisions \\nthat should be considered by fiduciaries of those plans and their legal advisors.  \\nFiduciary Duty  \\nIn considering an investment in the Fund, plan fiduciaries should consider their basic fiduciary \\nduty under ERISA Section 404, which requires them to discharge their investment duties prudently \\nand solely in the interest of the plan participants and beneficiaries.  \\nBefore au thorizing an investment in the Fund, plan fiduciaries should consider, among other \\nthings: (i) the fiduciary standards under ERISA; (ii) whether the investment in the Fund satisfies \\nthe prudence and diversification requirements of ERISA, including whether the investment is \\nprudent in light of limitations on the marketability of the Shares in the Fund; (iii) whether such \\nfiduciaries have authority to make the investment under the appropriate plan investment policies \\nand governing instrument and under Title I  of ERISA; and (iv) whether the investment will give \\nrise to a “prohibited transaction” within the meaning of Section 406 of ERISA or Section 4975 of \\nthe U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “ Code ”). In analyzing the prudence of \\nan investmen t in the Fund, special attention should be given to the DOL regulation on investment \\nduties (29 C.F.R. Section 2550.404a -1). \\nPlan Assets  \\nUnder ERISA and regulations issued by the DOL, when a plan covered by ERISA acquires an \\nequity interest (such as the Sh ares) in an entity (such as the Fund) that is neither a “publicly offered \\nsecurity” nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the Investment \\nCompany Act, as amended, the assets of the ERISA plan generally include not only such equity \\ninterest, but also an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of such entity, unless it is \\nestablished that: (i) the entity is an “operating company,” including a “venture capital operating \\ncompany” as defined in the DOL regulations (a “ VCOC ”); or (ii) ownership of each class of equity \\ninterest in the entity by “benefit plan investors” (within the meaning of DOL regulations as \\nmodified by section 3(42) of ERISA) has a value in the aggregate of less than 25% of the total \\nvalue of such class of eq uity interest then outstanding, determined on the date of the most recent \\nacquisition of any equity interest in the entity (the “ 25% Test ”). \\nFor purposes of the 25% Test, the term “benefit plan investor” includes (i ) any employee benefit \\nplan subject to part 4 of Title I of ERISA; (ii) any plan, account or arrangement to which section \\n4975 of the Code applies; and (iii) any entity whose underlying assets include “plan assets” by'),\n",

An entity will be considered a benefit plan investor only to \\nthe extent of the percentage of its equity interests that are held by benefit plan investors. Under the \\n25% Test, the value of equity interests held by a person (other than a “benefit plan investor”) that \\nhas discretionary authority or control with respect to the assets of the entity or that provides \\ninvestment advice for a fee (direct or indirect) with respect to such assets (or an associate of such \\nperson ) is disregarded.  \\nThe Directors will use commercially reasonable efforts to conduct the affairs and op erations of the \\nFund so that the Fund’s assets will not be deemed to constitute “plan assets” subject to ERISA by \\neither (i) qualifying the Fund as a VCOC or (ii) limiting investment in the Fund by “benefit plan \\ninvestors” (within the meaning of DOL regula tions as modified by section 3(42) of ERISA) to less \\nthan 25% of each class of equity interests in the Fund.  \\nForm 5500  \\nPlan administrators of investors that are subject to ERISA may be required to report on Form 5500 \\nAnnual Return/Report compensation paid to service providers. The descriptions contained herein \\nof fees and compensation are intended to satisfy the disclosure requirements for \"eligible indirect \\ncompensation\" for which the alternative reporting option on Schedule C of Form 5500 may be \\navailable . \\nProspective investors in the Fund such as pension funds that are subject to the provisions of \\nERISA should consult with their counsel and advisors as to the provisions of ERISA \\napplicable to an investment in the Fund.  \\nCertain  U.S. Securities Laws Matters  \\nIt is anticipated that the Fund, being comprised of a limited liability company organized outside the \\nUnited States and not intending to make a public offering of its securities in the United States, will \\nnot be required to registe r under the Investment Company Act. In order to ensure that the Fund will \\nnot be subject to the registration requirements of the Investment Company Act, the Directors will \\nensure that the outstanding securities in Fund are beneficially owned by not more th an 100  U.S. \\npersons who meet the conditions with respect to beneficial ownership contained in Sectio n 3(c)(1) of \\nthe Investment Company Act, or that the Fund’s  U.S. investors consist only of “qualified \\npurchasers” pursuant to the exemption contained in Sec tion 3(c)(7) of the Investment Company \\nAct. The Directors will obtain appropriate representations and undertakings from the Shareholders \\nto ensure that the conditions of the applicable exemption are met.'),\n",

The following doe s not purport to be a \\ncomprehensive summary of all of the risks associated with an investment in the Fund. Rather, the \\nfollowing are only certain risks to which the Fund is subject and that the Investment Manager wishes \\nto encourage prospective investors t o discuss in detail with their professional advisers.  \\nGeneral Fund and Business Risk Factors  \\n1. New Enterprise; Potential of Loss . The Fund is an enterprise with a short operating history \\nupon which prospective investors may evaluate their performance and the Fund is subject to \\nall of the business risks and uncertainties associated with any new fund. Accordingly, an \\ninvestment in the Fund entails a high degree of risk. There can be no assurance that the Fund \\nwill achieve their investment obj ectives or that the strategies described herein will be \\nsuccessful. Given the factors that are described below, there exists a possibility that an \\ninvestor could suffer a substantial loss as a result of an investment in the Fund.  \\n2. Forecast Risk . Historical facts, information and trends gained from historic experiences, \\npresent facts, circumstances and information, and assumptions from all or any of these do \\nnot guide the future. Aims, targets, plans, intentions and projections referred to are no more \\nthan th at and so do not imply a forecast. Past performance is not necessarily a guide to future \\nperformance.  \\n3. Uncertainty of Financial Projections Risk . The Investment Manager will generally \\nestablish the capital structure of the relevant Borrower Companies on the  basis of financial \\nprojections for such Borrower Companies. Projected operating results will normally be based \\nprimarily on management judgments or third -party reports. In all cases, projections are only \\nestimates of future results that are based upon ass umptions made at the time that the \\nprojections are developed. There can be no assurance that the projected results will be \\nobtained, and actual results may vary significantly from the projections. General economic \\nconditions, which are not predictable, can  have a material adverse impact on the reliability \\nof such projections. Certain Investments, as well as the Fund and the Directors, may rely on \\nreports of technical consultants when evaluating the condition of the assets or other elements \\nof an Investment.  The actual condition of an Investment or other elements of a Borrower \\nCompany may be worse than anticipated, requiring adjustments such as additional capital or \\nmaintenance expenditures which may not be recoverable, allocable to counterparties or \\neconomic  from a stand -alone point of view.  \\n4. General Economic Conditions The success of the Fund's activities will be affected by general \\neconomic and market conditions, such as interest rates, availability of credit, credit defaults, \\ninflation rates, economic uncertainty, changes in laws (including laws relating to taxation of  \\nportfolio investments), trade barriers, currency exchange controls, and national and \\ninternational political, environmental and socioeconomic circumstances (including wars, \\nterrorist acts or security operations and actual or threatened epidemics or pandem ics, such as \\nthe novel coronavirus outbreak that arose in China in December 2019 and continues to spread\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 59}, page_content=\"50 \\n internationally (COVID -19)). Instability in the markets will also likely increase the  risks \\ninherent in the portfolio investments. There can be no assu rance that such economic and \\nmarket conditions will be favourable in respect of both the investment and disposition \\nactivities of the Fund. Global financial markets in recent years have experienced periods of \\nunprecedented turmoil and markets have been neg atively impacted by significant write -offs \\nin the financial services sector relating investments such as subprime mortgages and the re -\\npricing of credit risk in the broader market, among other things. These events, along with the \\ndeterioration of the housi ng market, the failure of major financial institutions and the concerns \\nthat other financial institutions as well as the global financial system were also experiencing \\nsevere economic distress materially and adversely impacted the broader financial and cre dit \\nmarkets and reduced the availability of debt and equity capital for the market as a whole and \\nfinancial firms in particular. These events contributed to severe market volatility and caused \\nsevere liquidity strains in the credit markets. Volatile financ ial markets can expose the Fund \\nto greater market and liquidity risk. Risks to a robust resumption of growth persist: a weak \\nconsumer sector, high unemployment rates, the growing size of budget deficits and national \\ndebt of countries around the world, incl uding those in Africa, the threat of inflation and the \\nuncertain economic consequences of the novel coronavirus (COVID -19). Moreover, it \\nremains unknown whether governmental measures in any country which have been \\nundertaken in response to such turmoil (wh ether regulatory or financial in nature) will have a \\npositive or negative effect on market conditions. Potential investors also should recognize that \\nthe Investment Manager may determine to delay portfolio company realization events as a \\nresult of general economic conditions, illiquidity of portfolio investments, contractual \\nprohibitions, or for other reasons. The ability of companies to refinance may depend on their \\nability to sell new securities.  \\n5. Performance Risk . The performance of the Fund  may not meet the target yield and return. \\nNeither the Investment Manager nor any of its affiliates guarantee any level of return to \\nShareholders. Past performance of other investments made by Enko or its affiliates cannot be \\ntaken as an indication of the future perform ance of the Fund.  \\n6. Availability of Investments . The success of the Fund depends on the Investment Manager’s \\nabilities to identify and select appropriate investment opportunities as well as the Fund’s \\nability to acquire these Investments. There is no guarantee that suitable Investments will be \\nor can be secured, or that they will be successful. No assurance is given that the Fund’s \\ninvestment objectives will be achieved.  \\n7. Unspecified use of Proceeds . Purchasers of Shares will not have an opportunity to evaluate for \\nthemselves the relevant economic, financial and other information regarding the Investments \\nto be made by the Fund and, accordingly, will be dependent upon the judgment and ability of \\nthe Investment Manager in investing and managing the capita l of the Fund. No assurance can \\nbe given that the Fund will be successful in obtaining suitable Investments, or that if such \\nInvestments are made, the objectives of the Fund will be achieved.  \\n8. No Current Income . The Fund's investment policies should be considered speculative, as \\nthere can be no assurance that the Investment Manager's assessments of the short -term or \\nlong-term prospects of Investments will generate a profit. In view of the fact that the Fund \\nwill likely not pay dividends, an investment in  the Fund is not suitable for investors seeking \\ncurrent income for financial or tax planning purposes.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 60}, page_content=\"51 \\n 9. Trading Risks . The success of the Fund's investment activities will depend on the Investment  \\nManager's ability to identify and exploit price discrepanci es in corporate and government \\nevents. Identification and exploitation of such opportunities involve uncertainty. No \\nassurance can be given that the Investment Manager will be able to locate investment \\nopportunities or to correctly exploit price discrepanc ies in corporate and government events. \\nA reduction in the pricing inefficiency of corporate or government events in which the Fund \\nwill seek to invest will reduce the scope for the Fund's investment strategies. In the event that \\nthe perceived mispricings underlying the Fund's positions were to fail to converge toward, or \\nwere to diverge further from, relationships expected by the Investment Manager, the Fund \\nmay incur a loss.  \\n10. Competition . The securities industry and the arbitrage business in particular, ar e extremely \\ncompetitive. The Fund competes with firms, including many of the larger investment banking \\nfirms, which have substantially greater financial resources than does the Investment Manager \\nand substantially greater research staffs and more securitie s traders than does the Investment \\nManager. In any given transaction, arbitrage activity by other firms may tend to narrow the \\nspread between the price at which a security may be purchased by the Fund and the price it \\nexpects to receive upon consummation o f the transaction.  \\n11. Risks of Special Techniques Used by the Investment Manager . The Fund may invest using \\nspecial investment techniques that may subject the Fund's Investments to certain risks. \\nCertain, but not all, of these techniques and the risks that they entail are summarized herein. \\nThe Fund, in any event, is not designed to correlate to the broad equity market, and should be \\nviewed as an alternative to, instead of a substitute for, equity investments.  \\n12. Reliance on Certain Information . The Invest ment Manager may elect to invest in securities \\non the basis of information and data filed by the issuers of such securities with the SEC or \\nmade directly available to the Investment Manager by the issuers of the securities and other \\ninstruments or through sources other than the issuers. Although the Investment Manager \\nevaluates all such information and data and seeks independent corroboration when it \\nconsiders it appropriate and when it is reasonably available, the Investment Manager is not in \\na position to  confirm the completeness, genuineness or accuracy of such information and data.  \\n13. Concentration of Investments . From time to time a significant portion of the Fund's capital \\nmay be concentrated in a particular security, industry, market or country. Should s uch \\nsecurity, industry, market or country become subject to adverse financial conditions, the \\nFund's capital shall not be afforded the protection otherwise available through greater \\ndiversification of its Investments. In addition, the Fund may only make a limited number of \\nInvestments and because many of the Investments may involve a high degree of risk, poor \\nperformance by a few Investments could materially affect the total returns to the Fund.  \\n14. Exchange Rules . Each securities exchange typically has the rig ht to suspend or limit trading \\nin all securities that it lists. Such a suspension would render it impossible for the Fund to \\nliquidate positions and, accordingly, could expose the Fund to losses. Similarly, the Directors \\nhave the right to suspend or limit redemptions when, in their opinion, the Fund's net assets \\nare not sufficiently liquid to fund redemptions.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 61}, page_content=\"52 \\n 15. Short Selling and Leverage . The Investment program may include such investment \\ntechniques as short selling and leverage which practices can, in certa in circumstances,  \\nmaximize the adverse impact to which the Fund's Investments may be subject.  \\n16. Short Selling . The Fund may sell short securities of an issuer in the expectation of covering \\nthe short sale with securities purchased in the open market at a pri ce lower than that received \\nin the short sale. If the price of the issuer's securities declines, the Fund may then cover the \\nshort position with securities purchased in the market. The profit realized on a short sale will \\nbe the difference between the pric e received in the sale and the cost of the securities purchased \\nto cover the sale. The possible losses from selling short a security differ from losses that could \\nbe incurred from a cash investment in the security; the former may be unlimited, whereas the \\nlatter can only equal the total amount of the cash investment. Short selling activities are also \\nsubject to restrictions imposed by the federal securities laws and the various national and \\nregional securities exchanges, which restrictions could limit the F und's investment activities. \\nThere can be no assurance that securities necessary to cover a short position will be available \\nfor purchase.  \\n17. Leverage . The Fund expects to use leverage in its investment program when deemed \\nappropriate by the Investment Manager and subject to applicable regulations. Leverage \\ncreates an opportunity for greater yield and total return, but at the same time increases \\nexposure to capital risk and higher current expenses. If the Fund purchases securities on \\nmargin an d the value of those securities fall, the Fund may be obligated to pay down the \\nmargin loans to avoid liquidation of the securities. If loans to the Fund are collateralized with \\nportfolio securities that decrease in value, the Fund may be obligated to prov ide additional \\ncollateral to the lender in the form of cash or securities to avoid liquidation of the pledged \\nsecurities. Any such liquidation could result in substantial losses. Moreover, counterparties \\nof the Fund, in their sole discretion, may change th e leverage limits that they extend to the \\nFund.  \\n18. Option Trading . In seeking to enhance performance or hedge capital, the Fund may purchase \\nand sell call and put options on both securities and stock indexes. A stock index measures the \\nmovement of a certain g roup of stocks by assigning relative values to the common stocks \\nincluded in the index. Examples of well -known stock indexes are the S&P 500 and the FTSE \\n100 Index. Both the purchasing and the selling of call and put options contain risks. Although \\nan opti on buyer's risk is limited to the amount of the purchase price of the option, an investment \\nin an option may be subject to greater fluctuation than an investment in the underlying \\nsecurities. In theory, the exposure to loss is potentially unlimited in the case of an uncovered \\ncall writer (i.e. a call writer who does not have and maintain during the term of the call an \\nequivalent long position in the stock or other security underlying the call), but in practice the \\nloss is limited by the term of existence of  the call. The risk for a writer of an uncovered put \\noption (i.e., a put option written by a writer that does not have and maintain an offsetting short \\nposition in the underlying stock or other security) is that the price of the underlying security \\nmay fal l below the exercise price. The effectiveness of purchasing or selling stock index \\noptions as a hedging technique may depend upon the extent to which price movements in \\ninvestments that are hedged to correlate with price movements of the stock index select ed. \\nBecause the value of an index option depends upon movement in the level of the index rather \\nthan the price of a particular stock, whether a gain or loss will be realized from the purchase\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 62}, page_content=\"53 \\n or writing of options on an index depends upon movements in the level of stock prices in the \\nstock market generally, rather than movements in the price of a particular stock.  \\n19. Illiquidity of Shares . An investment in the Fund is a long -term commitment and transfers of \\nShares are restricted. There is no market for Shares and, accordingly, Shares may be disposed \\nof only through the redemption procedures described elsewhere in this Memorandum. Under \\ncertain circumstances, such redemption procedures may entail significant delays. The Fund \\nmay invest part of its assets in illi quid securities and may not be able to readily dispose of such \\nilliquid securities and, in some cases, may be contractually prohibited from disposing of such \\nsecurities for a specified period of time. The Fund's ability to exit from a particular Investment  \\nwill therefore depend largely on the terms of the agreements it enters into at the time of its \\nInvestments and its own efforts. Such illiquidity may continue even if the underlying companies \\nobtain listings on securities exchanges. The securities markets of many African countries are \\nsubstantially smaller and less liquid than the major securities markets in the United States and \\nEurope. The Fund generally will not be able to sell its securities publicly unless their sale is \\nregistered under applicable secu rities laws, or unless an exemption from such registration \\nrequirements is available. If the Fund does invest in or hold any publicly -traded securities, these \\nInvestments may be sensitive to movements in the stock market and trends in the overall \\neconomy.  \\n20. Disposition of Investments . In connection with the disposition of an Investment in a Borrower \\nCompany, the Fund may be required to make representations about the business and financial \\naffairs of the Borrower Company typical of those made in connection wit h the sale of any \\nbusiness, or may be responsible for the contents of disclosure documents under applicable \\nsecurities laws. The Fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such Investment \\nor underwriters to the extent that any such representa tions or disclosure documents turn out to \\nbe incorrect, inaccurate or misleading. These arrangements may result in contingent liabilities, \\nwhich might ultimately have to be funded by the Shareholders.  \\n21. Distributions/Redemptions in Cash or Kind . The Fund is not required to distribute cash or \\nother property to the Shareholders, and the Fund does not intend to make any such \\ndistributions.  \\n22. Notice Required . A Shareholder must give prior written notice to the Administrator to make \\na partial or total redemption of its Shares. During such notice period, the Shareholder's \\ninvestment remains at risk and may decrease in value from the date that notice of redemption \\nis made to the Administrator until the effective date of redemption.  \\n23. Compliance. The Fund mu st comply with various legal requirements, including requirements \\nimposed by the securities laws, tax laws and pension laws in various jurisdictions. Should \\nany of those laws change over the scheduled term of the Fund (in particular, both the level \\nand bas is of taxation), the legal requirements to which the Fund and the Shareholders may be \\nsubject could differ materially from current requirements.  \\nThe Investments will generally be governed by a complex series of legal documents and \\ncontracts. As a result, t he risk of a dispute over the interpretation or enforceability of legal \\ndocuments or contracts may be higher than for other investments.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 63}, page_content=\"54 \\n In addition, an investment in the Fund may involve tax considerations that differ for each \\nShareholder. Each investor i s encouraged to seek professional tax advice in connection with \\nany investment in the Fund.  \\n24. Reliance on Double Taxation Agreements (“DTAs”) . Investors should note that taxation of \\nthe income of the Fund arising from its Investments  in a target country may be significantly \\nminimized under the provisions of a DTA. However, no assurance can be given that the terms \\nof that DTA will not be subject to re -negotiation in the future. Any change in the DTA could \\nhave a material adverse effect  on the returns of the Fund. There can be no assurance that the \\nFund will be able to obtain or maintain the benefit of the DTAs.  \\n25. Institutional Risk and Custodial Risks . The institutions, including firms and banks, with \\nwhich the Fund (directly or indirectl y) does business, or to which securities have been \\nentrusted for custodial and prime brokerage purposes, may encounter financial difficulties \\nthat impair the operational capabilities or the capital position of the Fund. There are risks \\ninvolved in dealing with custodians or prime brokers who hold assets of the Fund and who \\nsettle the Fund’s trades. Securities and other assets deposited with custodians or prime brokers \\nmay not be clearly identified as being assets of the Fund, and hence the Fund may be expos ed \\nto a credit risk with regard to such parties. In some jurisdictions, the Fund may only be an \\nunsecured creditor of its prime broker or custodian in the event of bankruptcy or \\nadministration of such broker. Further, there may be practical, or time proble ms associated \\nwith enforcing the Fund’s rights to its assets in the event of the insolvency of any such party \\n(including sub -custodians or agents appointed by the custodian in jurisdictions where sub -\\ncustodians are not available).  \\nRecent apparently significant losses incurred by many hedge funds in relation to the \\nbankruptcy and/or administration of financial institutions illustrate the risks incurred in both \\nderivatives trading and custody and prime brokerage arrangements. Assets deposite d with \\nprime brokers or custodians which are fully paid (being those not held by the prime broker as \\nmargin) may be held in segregated safe custody in accordance with the prime brokerage and \\ncustodian agreements. Assets held as collateral by the prime brok ers or custodians in relation \\nto facilities offered to the Fund and assets deposited as margin with the custodians and prime \\nbrokers may therefore be available to the creditors of such persons in the event of their \\ninsolvency.  \\nThe banking and other financi al systems in some jurisdictions may not be well developed or \\nwell regulated. Delays in transfers by banks may result, as may liquidity crises and other  \\nproblems arising as a result of the under -capitalisation of the banking sector as a whole.  \\n26. Reserves . Under certain circumstances, the Fund may find it necessary to establish a reserve \\nfor contingent liabilities or withhold a portion of the Shareholder's settlement proceeds at the \\ntime of redemption, in which case the reserved portion would remain at the ris k of the Fund's \\nactivities.  \\n27. Forced Liquidation . Substantial redemptions by Shareholders within a short period of time \\ncould require the Investment Manager to liquidate positions more rapidly than would \\notherwise be desirable, which could adversely affect t he value of the Fund’s capital. The \\nresulting reduction in the Fund’s capital could make it more difficult to generate a positive \\nrate of return or to recoup losses due to a reduced equity base. Additionally, such substantial\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 64}, page_content=\"55 \\n redemptions may increase the s hare of the fees and expenses payable by the remaining \\nShareholders.  \\n28. Litigation and Claims . The Fund and the Investment Manager, as independent legal entities, \\nmay be subject to lawsuits or proceedings by government entities or private parties. Except \\nin the event of a lawsuit or proceeding arising from a Director's or the Investment Manager's \\ngross negligence, wilful default or fraud in the performance of its duties, expenses or \\nliabilities of the Fund arising from any suit shall be borne by the Fund.  \\n29. Need  for Independent Advice . The Investment Manager has consulted with counsel, \\naccountants and other experts regarding the formation of the Fund. Each prospective investor \\nshould consult his own legal, tax and financial advisers regarding the desirability of an \\ninvestment in the Fund.  \\n30. Registration . The Fund is not registered as an investment company under the  U.S. Investment \\nCompany Act (or any similar state laws). Investors, therefore, will not be accorded the \\nprotective measures provided by such legislation.  \\n31. Currency Exposure. The Shares of the Fund are denominated in  U.S. Dollars and will be \\nissued and redeemed in U.S. Dollars. The Fund’s business will be subject to risks typical of \\nan international business including, but not limited to, differing tax structures and general \\nforeign exchange rate volatility. For any Investments denominated in a foreign currency, the \\nvalue of the investment in the Fund’s Functional Currency will vary with movements in \\nexchange rates, to the extent that the exchange rate exposure is not hedged. The Fund, at the \\ndiscretion of the Investment Manager, may employ hedging techniques desi gned to reduce the \\nrisks of adverse movements in currency exchange rates. While such transactions may reduce \\ncertain risks, such transactions themselves may entail certain other risks. Thus, while the Fund \\nmay benefit from the use of these hedging mechanis ms, unanticipated changes in currency \\nexchange rates may result in a poorer overall performance for the Fund than would have been \\nthe case if it had not entered into such hedging transactions. Moreover, in some African \\ncountries, the markets for hedging in struments are not as well developed and may be restricted \\nby governmental regulation. Furthermore, whilst the Fund may seek to take steps to hedge \\nagainst currency exposure both in respect of the Fund and in respect of the currency classes, \\ncurrency risk t o the Fund and/or the Shareholders will not be entirely eliminated. Additionally, \\nthe Fund will incur costs in converting investment proceeds from one currency to another and \\nBorrower Companies may incur foreign exchange costs to cover the costs of any  U.S. Dollar \\n(or any other applicable currency) financing arrangements.  \\n32. Allocation of Liabilities Among Classes of Shares – Cross -Class Liability . Although the \\nFund will maintain separate accounts or book entries with respect to each Class of Shares, \\nseparate Classes of Shares are not separate legal entities but rather Classes of Redeemable \\nShares in the Fund. The Fund as a whole, including all such separate Classes, is one legal \\nentity. Thus, all of the assets of the Fund are available to meet all of the liabi lities of the Fund, \\nregardless of the Classes of Shares to which such assets or liabilities are attributable. In \\npractice, cross class liability will usually only arise where any separate Class of Shares \\nbecomes insolvent and is unable to meet all of its l iabilities. In this case, all of the assets of \\nthe Fund attributable to other separate Classes of Shares may be applied to cover the liabilities \\nof the insolvent Classes of Shares.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 65}, page_content=\"56 \\n 33. Shareholder Loss . No Shareholder will be liable for losses or debts of the Fund beyond that \\nShareholder's investment nor may any Shareholder be assessed or otherwise required to invest \\nmore than its initial investment. Accordingly, the Fund’s ability to meet its own financial \\ncommitments and to conduct its business may be impaire d. \\n34. Economic and Business Conditions . General economic and business conditions in relevant \\njurisdictions, as well as conditions of domestic and international financial markets, may affect \\nthe Fund's activities. Interest rates, the prices of securities and participation by other investors \\nin the financial markets may affect the value of securities purchased by the Fund. Unexpected \\nvolatility or liquidity in the markets in which the Fund directly or indirectly holds positions \\ncould impair the F und’s ability to carry out its business and could cause it and, therefore, the \\nFund to incur losses.  \\n35. Force Majeure. Force Majeure is the term generally used to refer to events of a catastrophic \\nnature beyond the control of a party claiming that the event h as occurred, including acts of God, \\nfire, flood, earthquake, war, strike, droughts, famine typhoons and terrorist attacks. Some Force \\nMajeure risks are generally uninsurable or insurable at such high rates that to maintain such \\ncoverage would cause an adve rse impact on the related Investments. In general, losses related \\nto terrorism are becoming harder and more expensive to insure against. Some insurers are \\nexcluding terrorism coverage from their all -risk policies. In some cases, the insurers are offering \\nsignificantly limited coverage against terrorist acts for additional premiums, which can greatly \\nincrease the total cost of casualty insurance. As a result, all Investments may not be insured \\nagainst terrorism. This is particularly relevant for certain coun tries in Africa in which terrorism \\nis a real and prevalent threat. A Force Majeure event may adversely affect a party’s ability to \\nperform its obligations until it is able to remedy the Force Majeure event. In some cases, project \\nagreements can be terminat ed if the Force Majeure event is so catastrophic that it cannot be \\nremedied within a reasonable time period and the Fund could lose both invested capital in and \\nanticipated profits from the affected Investments. In general, the Investment Manager will have  \\ndiscretion as to the type and level of insurance coverage to obtain, or whether to obtain \\ninsurance at all.  \\n36. Sovereign Risk. The concessions of certain Investments are granted by government bodies \\nand are subject to special risks, including the risk that t he relevant government bodies will \\nexercise sovereign rights and take actions contrary to the rights of the Fund or the Borrower \\nCompany under the relevant concession agreement. There can be no assurance that the \\nrelevant government bodies will not legisla te, impose regulations or change applicable laws \\nor act contrary to the law in a way that would materially and adversely affect the business of \\nthe Investments.  \\n37. Access to Information; Enhanced Liquidity. The Investment Manager will generally provide \\nShareholders with monthly unaudited information regarding the Fund’s performance. To the \\nextent permitted by applicable laws, the Fund, however, may give one or more Shareholders \\naccess to more frequent and/or more detailed information regarding the Fund’s securities \\npositions, performance and finances. In addition, subject to any redemption fee, the Fund may \\ngive certain Shareholders (including those given such additional information) the right to \\nredeem all or  a portion of their Shares on shorter notice and/or with more frequency than the \\nterms described in this Memorandum. As a result, certain Shareholders may be better able to \\nassess the prospects and performance of the Fund than other Shareholders, and may b e able\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 66}, page_content=\"57 \\n to redeem their Shares at times when other Shareholders may not. The Fund may enter into \\nseparate letter agreements with a particular Shareholder in respect of any such matters.  \\n38. Money Laundering. As part of the Investment Manager’s responsibilities for the prevention \\nof money laundering under applicable laws, the Fund may require a detailed verification of a \\nprospective investor and the source of such investor’s funding. In the event of delay or failure \\nby a prospective investor to produce any such i nformation required for verification purposes, \\nthe Fund may refuse to admit the investor to the Fund. The Fund may also decline to accept \\nan investor's subscription on the basis of the information that is provided. Requests for \\ndocumentation and additional  information may be made at any time during which a \\nShareholder holds Shares. The Investment Manager may from time to time be obligated to \\nfile reports with regulatory authorities in various jurisdictions (in certain circumstances \\nwithout notifying the Sha reholders that the information has been provided) with regard to, \\namong other things, the identity of the Fund’s Shareholders and suspicious activities \\ninvolving the Shares.  \\nIn the event it is determined that a Shareholder or any direct or indirect owner o f a Shareholder \\nis a person identified in any of these laws as a prohibited person, or is otherwise engaged in \\nactivities of the type prohibited under these laws, the Investment Manager may be obligated, \\namong other actions, to prohibit a Shareholder from making further contributions of capital to \\nthe Fund, to withhold settlement distributions or any other funds otherwise owing to that \\nShareholder or place such settlement distributions in an escrow account or to cause such \\nShareholder’s Shares to be cancell ed or otherwise redeemed.  \\n39. Interest Rate Risk. The Net Asset Value of the Fund, to the extent invested in debt securities, \\nwill be affected by changes in the general level of interest rates. The Net Asset Value is \\nexpected to increase from a fall in interes t rates while it would be adversely affected by an \\nincrease in the level of interest rates. Debt securities are subject to the risk of the issuer’s \\ninability to meet interest payments on its obligations.  \\n40. Inflation risk. Inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have negative effects on the \\neconomics and markets of economy of Africa. Inflation assumptions are implicit in revenue \\nand cost forecasts upon which investment decisions are made. Variances between anticipated \\nand actual inflation could neg atively affect returns.  \\n41. Credit and Market Risk . The Fund will be investing in debt securities which involve credit \\nrisk that is, the risk of an issuer’s inability to pay the principal payments. In addition, the \\nvalue of a fixed income security will fluctua te depending on the actual changes in the \\nperceived level of credit risk as well as the actual event of default. Such Investments may also \\nbe subject to price volatility due to factors such as changes in interest rates, general level of \\nmarket liquidity an d market perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer, referred to as the \\nmarket risk.  \\n42. Borrower Company Management . With respect to management at the Borrower Company \\nlevel, many Borrower Companies may rely on the services of a limited number of key \\nindividuals, the loss of any one of whom could significantly adversely affect the Investment’s \\nperformance. Although the  Investment Manager expects to monitor the management of each\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 67}, page_content='58 \\n relevant Borrower Company, the management team of each Borrower Company will have day -\\nto-day responsibility with respect to the business of such Investment . \\n43. Non-control position Risk. The Fund m ay make Investments in Borrower Companies where it \\nmay have limited influence. Such Borrower Companies may have economic or business interests \\nor goals that are inconsistent with those of the Fund and the Fund may not be in a position to \\nlimit or otherwise  protect the value of its Investment in such Borrower Companies.  \\nThe Fund’s control over the investment policies of such Borrower Companies may also be \\nlimited. This could result in the Fund’s Investments being frozen in minority positions that \\nincur substantial losses.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 68}, page_content=\"59 \\n Risk Factors Relating to Africa  \\nDescribed below are certain risk factors peculiar to investing in African markets. These require \\nconsideration of matters not usually associated with investing in securities of issuers in the develope d \\ncapital markets of North America, Japan or Western Europe. The economic and political conditions \\ndiffer from those in Western markets, and offer less social, political and economic stability. The \\nabsence in many cases, until relatively recently, of any m ove towards capital markets structures or to \\na free market economy means investing in these countries is more risky than investing in Western \\nmarkets. These risks are likely to exist to a greater or lesser degree in most of the markets in which \\nthe Fund ma y invest.  \\n1. Political and Economic Risks . Although the recent trend on the African continent has been \\ntowards more open markets and the promotion of private business initiatives, no assurance \\ncan be given that the governments of the countries of Africa will continue to pursue such \\npolicies or that  such policies may not be altered significantly. This may potentially result in \\nnationalisation, expropriation or confiscation of assets, punitive taxation, increased or adverse \\ngovernment regulation, social instability, corruption, or the imposition of ec onomic sanctions.  \\nCountries in Africa are susceptible to unrest arising from economic hardship, discontent with \\nprivatisation programmes, social and/or ethnic instability, and changes in government \\nleadership, institutions and policies. Future changes in g overnment, major policy shifts or lack \\nof consensus between various branches of the government and powerful economic groups, \\ncould disrupt economic and regulatory reforms and create an uncertain business environment \\nwhich could adversely affect the value o f the Fund’s Investments on the African continent. \\nTerrorism in African countries, together with any related negative effects on neighbouring \\nstates or region as a whole, may have a negative effect on the assets of the Fund.  \\nStock markets in the emerging markets tend to be more volatile than some of those in \\ndeveloped countries and this may affect the liquidity of the Fund’s Investments which are \\nlisted on stock exchanges in such markets.  \\nThe Fund's Investments may be (or may become in the future)  subject to foreign exchange \\ncontrols that may adversely affect the ability to repatriate the income or proceeds from the sale \\nof the Fund’s Investments.  \\nRepatriation of income, capital and the proceeds from sales of Investments by the Fund may \\nrequire gov ernment consents. Delays in or a refusal to grant such approval, or a revocation or \\nvariation of consents granted prior to Investments being made in any particular country, or \\nthe imposition of new restrictions, may adversely affect the Fund’s Investments.  \\nMany African economies are reliant on commodity -based industries for a significant portion \\nof their GDP and are vulnerable to market downturns and economic slowdowns elsewhere in \\nthe world and the impact this may have on commodity prices and investment  priorities. As has \\nhappened in the past, a softening of commodity prices, financial problems or an increase in the \\nperceived risks associated with investing in emerging economies could dampen foreign \\ninvestment in Africa and adversely affect the economies of  countries within the African region.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 69}, page_content='60 \\n Instability in neighbouring states could also impact movement and trading of goods, \\nsubsequently impacting the revenue streams of Investments.  \\nThere is no assurance that political, economic and market reforms in Africa  will not be \\nsuspended or reversed. There are no assurances that the reform process that has begun will \\ncontinue and that the final outcome will be anything resembling a democratic, market -based \\nsociety as it is known in Western Europe and North America, o r that relationships with Western \\nnations will not deteriorate.  \\nAlthough legislation has been implemented to protect private property owners from \\nexpropriation and nationalisation, there is no assurance that such legislation could not at some \\npoint in the future be amended, that all of the rights and interests of owners and creditors of such \\nexpropriated and nationalised property would be protected, or that Shareholders would be fairly \\nand properly compensated in case of such nationalisation.  \\nNationalisatio n or expropriation could also occur indirectly through, for example, \\ndisenfranchisement of the shares of outside Shareholder or by concentration of voting power in \\nstate-owned shares. Furthermore, Borrower Companies in which the Fund invests may be, or \\nmay become, subject to unduly burdensome and restrictive regulation affecting their \\ncommercial freedom and thereby diminishing the value of the Fund’s Investment in them. \\nTherefore, restrictive or excessive government regulation may also be seen as a form of indirect \\nnationalisation.  \\nThe potential involvement with any politically exposed persons may impact perceptions of the \\nFund, which may lead to reputational risks and materially and adversely affect the value of \\nInvestments made by the Fund.  \\nThe Fund will, where available at a commercially acceptable level and considered appropriate, \\ntake out political risk cover in order to mitigate the impact of the above -mentioned risks.  \\n2.   Regulatory Risk. The issuers of instruments in which the Fund invests may be or become subject \\nto unduly burdensome and restrictive regulation affecting commercial freedom and this in turn \\nmay have an adverse impact on the value of the Fund and therefore the value of the S hares. \\nOver -regulation may therefore be a form of indirect nationalisation.  \\n3.   Nature of Investments and Market Risks . Investments to be made by the Fund carry risks not \\nusually associated with investing in securities in more developed markets. The Fund is likely to \\nexperience greater price volatility and significantly lower liquidity than if invested in more \\ndeveloped markets. With nascent capital markets in many of the countries in which the Fund may \\ninvest, there are often severe difficulties in meeting i nvestor demand for the available debt and/or \\nequity instruments. This can lead to primary issues and auctions of debt instruments being greatly \\noversubscribed.  \\nDebt obligations acquired by the Fund are likely to have no credit rating or a low rating. Such \\nsecurities may involve greater risks of loss of income and principal than rated or  higher -rated \\nsecurities and are speculative in nature. Although they may offer higher yields than do higher -\\nrated securities, they generally involve greater price volatility  and risk of default in payment of \\nprincipal and income.'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 70}, page_content=\"61 \\n The use of synthetic products can overcome problems and mitigate certain risks associated with \\ndirect investment in the underlying obligations. Such products expose the Fund to counterparty \\nand other  risks (as summarised below).  \\nNo assurance can be given that Investments acquired by the Fund will continue to earn yields \\ncomparable to those earned historically, nor can any assurance be given that issuers whose \\nobligations the Fund acquires will make pa yments on such obligations as they become due.  \\n4. Synthetic Product and Subsidiary Risk. The synthetic products in which the Fund may invest are \\nsubject to counterparty and regulatory risks including, but not limited to the risks described in this \\nparagraph. The counterparty risk lies with each party with whom the Fund contracts for the \\npurpose of making Investments and, where relevant, the entity in the country with whom the \\ncounterparty has made arrangements to ensure an onshore presence in the emerging coun try. The \\nFund may not be entitled to assert any rights against the entity in the emerging country with whom \\nit does not have a contractual relationship. The Fund may not be able to procure that the \\ncounterparty asserts its own rights, if any, against the o nshore entity in the country with whom it \\nhas made arrangements. In the event of the counterparty's insolvency, the Fund will only rank as \\nan unsecured creditor. In the event of the insolvency of any entity in the emerging country with \\nwhom the Fund does n ot have a contractual relationship, it is likely that the Fund will lose its \\nentire Investment. The effectiveness and legality of the synthetic product structure, and in \\nparticular the ability of the Fund's counterparty to invest efficiently in the country  from off -shore, \\nis subject to intervention by the relevant local authorities, their re -interpretation of law and current \\ncommercial and tax efficient practice and legislation, as well as to changes in relevant laws and \\nregulations. As a result, the Fund m ay not get back all or any part of its Investment in the synthetic \\nproducts in which it invests or it may find that the proceeds of its Investment are not repatriable. \\nIt may not be possible for the Fund to negotiate favourable terms for its Investment in synthetic \\nproducts. In some cases the Fund may be obliged to hold harmless and indemnify its counterparty \\nfrom and against all losses resulting from a breach by the Fund of its obligations or in respect of \\nall costs and expenses incurred by the counterpart y in relation to its arrangements with the on -\\nshore entity. If the underlying Investment remains unpaid or is re -scheduled (including being the \\nsubject of a moratorium, debt substitution, exchange or similar event) the Fund could lose part or \\nthe whole of its Investment. Similarly, if the underlying Investment or the synthetic product \\nstructure is re -characterised, the Fund may be forced to terminate its Investment in the synthetic \\nproduct earlier than had been anticipated and at a loss to par or all of the  Investment.  \\nThe Fund may be obliged to provide working capital to any subsidiary it incorporates by way \\nof share capital. If it is sought to repatriate capital out of any such subsidiary, the time it may \\ntake to liquidate such subsidiary or to reduce such subsidiary's share capital may delay the \\nmaking of payments to the Fund.  \\n5. Illiquidity of Investments. L Until a market develops, certain of the Fund's Investments may \\ngenerally be illiquid. There may be no established secondary market for certai n of the \\nInvestments made by the Fund. Reduced secondary market liquidity may affect adversely \\nthe market price of the Fund's Investments and the Fund's ability to dispose of particular \\nInvestments to meet its liquidity requirements or in response to speci fic events such as \\ndeterioration in the creditworthiness of any particular issuer. Due to the lack of adequate \\nsecondary market liquidity for certain securities, the Administrator may find it more \\ndifficult to obtain accurate market quotations for the purp oses of valuing the Fund and\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 71}, page_content=\"62 \\n calculating the net asset value. Market quotations may only be available from a limited \\nnumber of sources and may not represent firm bids for actual sales. In addition, the current \\nor future regulatory regime may adversely affe ct liquidity.  \\n6. Settlement Risk. Because of the absence of organised securities markets as well as the \\nunderdeveloped state of the legal, banking and telecommunications systems, concerns arise in \\nrelation to settlement, clearing and registration of transacti ons in securities. Furthermore, due to \\nthe local postal and banking systems, no guarantee can be given that all entitlements attaching to \\nsecurities acquired by the Fund, including interest and dividends, can be realised. However, none \\nof the Investment Ma nager or the Administrator or any of their agents makes any representation \\nor warranty about, or any guarantee of, the operation, performance, settlement, clearing and/or \\nregistration of Investments or the credit risks associated with dealing in any Invest ments which \\nthe Fund may make.  \\n7. Custody Risk. Custody services in many African countries remain undeveloped and, although \\nthe Investment Manager will endeavour  to put into place control mechanisms, including the \\nselection of agents to register Investments on behalf of the Fund and regular audits of entries on \\nrelevant registers to ensure that the Fund's interests continue to be recorded, there is a transaction \\nand custody risk of dealing in Africa.  \\nAlthough the Investment Manager will, so far as is possible, satisfy itself that each agent selected \\nto provide for the safe custody of Investments is fit and proper and that arrangements are in place \\nto safeguard the interests of the Investment Manager, Investment Manager will not be liable for \\nthe acts or omissions of any agent, nor for any losses suffered by the Fund as a result of the fraud, \\nnegligence, wilful default or the bankruptcy or insolvency of any agent. Up on the default of any \\nagent, many of the protections which would normally be provided to an investment fund by a \\ntrustee, custodian or sub -custodian will not be available to the Fund.  \\nIt must be appreciated that the Fund will be investing in countries where the current law and \\nmarket practice carries fewer safeguards than in more developed markets and that the \\nInvestment Manager can accept no liability for losses resulting from acting in accordance with \\nsuch practice.  \\n8. Possible Business Failure s. The insolvency or other business failure of any one or more of the \\nFund's Investments could have an adverse effect on the performance and ability to achieve its, \\nand therefore the Fund’s objectives. Many of the target investment countries have enacted o r are \\nin the process of enacting laws on the insolvency of enterprises, but there is as yet no significant \\nlevel of experience in how these laws will be implemented and applied in practice. The lack of \\ngenerally available financing alternatives for compani es in many of the target investment \\ncountries increases the risk of business failure.  \\n9. Accounting Practice. Accounting standards in the countries where the Fund may invest may \\nnot correspond to International Financial Reporting Standards in all material res pects. In \\naddition, auditing requirements and standards differ from those generally accepted in the \\ninternational capital markets and consequently information which would be available to \\ninvestors in developed capital markets is not always obtainable in re spect of companies in such \\ncountries.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 72}, page_content='63 \\n 10. Quality of Information. Investors in the countries where the Fund may invest generally have \\naccess to less reliable or less detailed information, including both general economic data and \\ninformation concerning the oper ations, financial results, capitalisation and financial obligations, \\nearnings and securities of specific enterprises. The quality and reliability of information available \\nto the Fund will, therefore, be less than in respect of investments in Western countr ies. \\nObligations on companies to publish information are also more limited, thus further restricting \\nopportunities for the Investment Manager to carry out due diligence. At present the Investment \\nManager will be obliged to make investment decisions and the  Administrator investment \\nvaluations on the basis of financial information that will be less complete and reliable than that \\ncustomarily available in the West. Also, the quality and reliability of official data published by \\nthe government and government ag encies are generally not equivalent to that of more developed \\nWestern countries.  \\n11. Legal Risks. Laws and regulations of the African region may not accord equivalent rights (or \\nprotection for such rights) relative to countries with more sophisticated laws and  regulations. \\nAdditionally, court claims are often used in the furtherance of political aims. The Fund’s \\nInvestments may be subject to such claims and may not be able to receive a fair hearing. \\nAdditionally, court judgments are not always enforced or follo wed by law enforcement \\nagencies.  \\nThe rate of legislative change in certain of the countries where the Fund may invest is extremely \\nrapid and the content of proposed legislation when eventually adopted into law is difficult or \\nimpossible to predict. Such pr oposed legislation may have an adverse effect on foreign \\ninvestment. It is similarly difficult to anticipate the impact of legislative reforms on securities \\nin which the Fund will invest. Although there is often significant political support for legislativ e \\nchange to bolster and facilitate the movement to a more developed market economy, it is not \\ncertain that legislation when enacted will advance this objective either consistently or in a \\ncoherent manner. In some cases, the magnitude of the changes taking place has resulted in a \\nlack of confidence in the courts to give clear and consistent judgments. Legislation can be \\npublished by a variety of governmental bodies and remaining up to date and in complete \\ncompliance with legal rules and standards can often b e difficult. There is also a lack of precedent \\nin relation to market -oriented legal relations for many of the local currency instruments.  \\n12. Taxation. Tax law and practice in countries in which the Fund may invest is not as clearly \\nestablished as that of the Western nations. It is possible therefore that the current \\ninterpretation of the law or understanding of practice may change or, indeed, that the law \\nmay be changed with retrospective effect. Accordingly, it is possible that the Fund could \\nbecome subje ct to taxation in the countries in which the Fund may invest that is not \\nanticipated either at the date of this Memorandum or when Investments are made, valued or \\ndisposed of. In addition, in certain countries where the Fund may invest, the domestic  tax \\nburden is high and the discretion of local authorities to create new forms of taxation has \\nresulted in a proliferation of taxes, in some cases imposed or interpreted retrospectively.  \\n13. Crime and Corruption. Organised  crime and corruption, including extortion and fraud, pose a \\nrisk to businesses in Africa. The Fund will only invest in projects where intensive due diligence \\nwas done and there is assurance that no corruption is found, or is considered a high risk, \\nimpact ing the Investment. Only legal networks will be used in procuring new deals through the \\nFund trusted networks in Africa. In addition, the Fund will implement measures aimed at'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 73}, page_content='64 \\n preventing it from being used as a vehicle for money laundering as well as measu res aimed at \\npreventing the solicitation or payment of bribes. However, there can be no absolute assurance \\nthat these measures will be completely effective. If the Fund is associated with crime and/or \\ncorruption, its reputation, financial condition or pros pects, and those of the Shareholders, could \\nbe materially adversely affected.  \\n14. Exchange and Currency Risk. Many of the currencies in which the Fund may invest are \\nneither freely convertible into one of the major currencies nor internationally traded. The lo cal \\ncurrencies may be convertible into other currencies only inside the relevant African countries \\nwhere the limited availability of such other currencies may tend to inflate their values relative \\nto the local currency in question. Such internal exchange m arkets can therefore be said to be \\nneither liquid nor competitive. In addition, many of the currencies of countries in which the \\nFund may invest have experienced steady devaluation relative to freely convertible \\ncurrencies.  \\nThe value of an investment in th e Fund, whose units are denominated in  U.S. dollars and whose \\ndistributions will be paid in  U.S. dollars, will be affected by fluctuations in the value of the \\nunderlying currency of denomination of the Fund\\'s Investments against the  U.S. dollar or by \\nchang es in exchange control regulations, tax laws, withholding taxes and economic or monetary \\npolicies. The local currencies in which the Fund may be invested from time to time may \\nexperience substantially greater volatility against the  U.S. dollar than the maj or convertible \\ncurrencies of developed countries. Adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates can result in \\na decrease in the net return and in a loss of capital for the Fund. Accordingly, investors must \\nrecognise that the value of units can fall as we ll as rise for this reason as can the ability to generate \\nsufficient income to pay a distribution in  U.S. dollars.  \\nThe Investment Manager may attempt to mitigate the risks associated with currency \\nfluctuations by entering into forward, futures and options contracts to purchase or sell the \\ncurrency of denomination of any Investment held by the Fund and any other currenc ies held \\nby the Fund, to the extent such contracts are available on acceptable terms. Investors should \\nrealise that such contracts may not be available in all of the currencies in which the Investment \\nManager may invest from time to time and may in the eve nt of major market disruptions or \\nfor other reasons be unenforceable.  \\n15. The Banking System. In addition to being under -developed, the local banking systems in \\nmany of the countries in which the Fund may invest are subject to two main risks; first, the \\ninsolv ency of a bank due to concentrated debtor risk and, second, the effect of inefficiency \\nand fraud in bank transfers. In addition, banks have not developed the infrastructure to \\nchannel domestic savings to companies in need of finance who thereby can experie nce \\ndifficulty in obtaining working capital. Trade embargoes, sanctions and other restrictions  \\n(\"restrictions \") may, from time to time, be imposed by international bodies (for example, \\nbut not limited to, the United Nations) or sovereign states (for exampl e, but not limited to, \\nthe United States) or their agencies on Investments held or to be held by the Fund. Such \\nrestrictions may result in an Investment or cash flows relating to an Investment being frozen \\nor otherwise suspended or restricted (\" suspensions \"). The Fund and the Investment \\nManager will not be liable for any losses suffered by the Fund as a result of the imposition \\nof such restrictions or as a result of suspensions being imposed on any Investment or any \\ncash flows associated with any Investment .'),\n",

Because of the risks involved, investment in the Fund is \\nonly suitable for sophisticated investors who are able to bear the loss of a substantial portion \\nor even all of the money they invest in the Fund, who understan d the high degree of risk \\ninvolved, believe that the investment is suitably based upon their investment objectives and \\nfinancial needs and recognise the potential illiquidity of such an investment which may affect \\nredemption of units. Investors are therefo re advised to seek independent professional advice \\non the implications of investing in the Fund.  \\nManagement Risks  \\n1. Reliance on Key Personnel. The success of the Fund depends in substantial part upon the  \\nskill and expertise of the members of the Investment Manager and others providing investment \\nadvice with respect to the Fund. There can be no assurance that these key investment professionals, \\nin particular Alain Nkontchou, will continue to be associated w ith the Investment Manager or that \\ntheir continued association with the Fund will guarantee the future success of the Fund. The loss of \\nkey personnel could have a material adverse effect on the Fund.  \\n2. Dependence on the Investment Manager. The Fund is depend ent upon the Investment Manager \\nand its personnel, in particular Alain Nkontchou, with respect to the Investment of the Fund’s \\ncapital and management of the assets and general administration of the Fund and Shareholders \\nshall have no rights with respect to  the administration, management or investment decisions of the \\nFund. The loss of the services of the Investment Manager may adversely affect the performance \\nof the Fund.  \\nTermination of the Investment Manager and Directors' appointments may only occur in limited \\ncircumstances pursuant to the terms of the Fund Documents. Any termination of a the Investment \\nManager’s appointment as manager of the Fund, or termination of a Dir ector as director of the \\nFund, may have material adverse consequences for the Fund in certain circumstances including, \\nbut not limited to, situations where government agencies, joint venture partners, lending \\ncounterparts or other parties have imposed cond itions of ongoing manager involvement with \\nBorrower Companies, as described elsewhere in this section.  \\nSuch consequences may include the acceleration of financing facilities made available to \\nBorrower Companies or the triggering of the right for co -investo rs (to acquire the relevant \\nPartnership’s interest in the relevant Investment).  \\nIn addition, certain contract counterparties, lenders or other entities may impose conditions of \\nongoing control or equivalent restrictions on the Fund or the Borrower Companie s. Such conditions \\nmay deem the relevant Investment Manager to ‘control’ the Fund and the termination of the \\nInvestment Manager’s appointment may therefore have material adverse  \\nconsequences on the Fund or a Borrower Company’s rights and obligations under the relevant \\ncontracts.  \\n3.  Board Participation. The Fund may be represented on the boards of directors of certain Borrower \\nCompanies or may have its representative’s serve as observers to such boards of directors. \\nAlthough such positions in certain circum stances may be important to the Fund’s investment \\nstrategy and may enhance the Investment Manager’s ability to manage such Investments, they \\nmay also have the effect of impairing the Investment Manager’s ability to sell the related securities \\nwhen, and upo n the terms, it may otherwise desire. The Investment Manager and the Fund may be \\nsubject to claims they would not otherwise be subject to as an investor, including claims of breach\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 75}, page_content='66 \\n of duty, securities claims and other director -related claims. In general, t he Borrower Companies, \\nand the Investment Manager will take out insurance policies to protect their representatives against \\nsuch risks. In the instance where such insurance is inadequate, the Fund will indemnify the \\nInvestment Manager and its respective ag ents, advisors, affiliates, shareholders, members, \\nmanagers, partners, officers, employees, directors and personnel against claims, liabilities, costs \\nand expenses, including legal fees, incurred by them by reason of their activities on behalf of the \\nFund or the Shareholders.  \\nPotential Conflicts of Interest Risks  \\n1. Conflicts generally . The Investment Manager, the Administrator, Prime Broker and the Custodian \\nand their respective affiliates, which shall be deemed to include, in each case, their respective \\nofficers, directors, employees and entities owned by any of the aforementioned parties (“ Related \\nParties ”) may face certain conflicts of interests in relation to the Fund. These conflicts include, \\nbut are not limited to, the following:  \\ni. The Investment Manager and each of its directors presently and will in the future,  \\ndirectly or indirectly, direct, sponsor or manage other investment funds or managed accounts \\nin addition to the Fund. The Investment Manager and each of its directors may have f inancial \\nor other incentives to favour some such investment funds or managed accounts over the \\nFund. The Investment Manager will make its own decisions for the Fund, which decisions \\nmay differ from time to time from those recommended by analysts of the Inv estment \\nManager for its other advisory clients.  \\nii. The Investment Manager believes that it will continue to have sufficient staff, personnel \\nand resources to perform all of its duties with respect to the Fund. However, because some \\nof the officers of the Inve stment Manager may have duties in connection with other \\ninvestment funds and other matters, such officers may have conflicts of interest in the \\nallocation of responsibilities, services and functions among the Fund and other entities similar to \\nthe Fund.  \\n \\niii. The Fund may invest capital in investment funds and/or with other accounts managed by \\nthe Investment Manager and/or its affiliates. As a result, the Investment Manager may \\nreceive fees based on these investments directly from the Fund and, directly or indi rectly, \\nfrom the other investment funds or accounts. Notwithstanding such circumstances, the \\nInvestment Manager will act in accordance with its fiduciary duties to the Shareholders.  \\nSome or all of the Related Parties may be involved with other entities uti lizing investment \\nstrategies similar to those of the Fund and with other business in general. The Investment \\nManager may cause the Fund to invest in securities in which some or all of the Related \\nParties have a financial interest, or to engage in transacti ons with brokers or others with \\nwhom some or all of the Related Parties have financial or other relationships.  \\n \\niv. The Related Parties may engage for their own accounts, or for the accounts of others, in \\nother business ventures of any nature, and the Fund has  no right to participate in or benefit \\nfrom the other management activities of the Investment Manager described above and the \\nRelated Parties shall not be obliged to account to the Fund for any profits or benefits made \\nor derived therefrom, nor shall they have any obligation to disclose or refer to the Fund \\nany of the investment or service opportunities obtained through such activities. Related'),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 76}, page_content=\"67 \\n Parties may own Shares in the Fund, deal as principals with the Fund in the sale or purchase \\nof Investments of the  Fund or act as brokers, whether to the Fund or to third parties, in the \\npurchase or sale of the Fund's investments and shall be entitled to retain any profits or \\ncustomary commissions resulting from such dealings.  \\n \\nv. The Investment Manager and/or its affili ates and/or its employees may from time to time \\nhave an interest, directly or indirectly, in a security, the purchase or sale of which by the \\nFund is recommended, or which in fact is purchased or sold by or otherwise traded for the \\nFund. Moreover, such rec ommendation, purchase, sale or trading may occur in connection \\nwith a transaction involving another investment fund or account managed by the \\nInvestment Manager. Accordingly, the Investment Manager may sell or recommend the \\nsale of a particular security fo r certain accounts, including accounts in which it has an \\ninterest, and it or others may buy or recommend the purchase of such security for other \\naccounts, including accounts in which it has an interest, and, thus, transactions in particular \\naccounts may n ot be consistent with transactions in other accounts or with the Investment \\nManager's investment recommendations. For example, the Investment Manager may \\nrecommend that the Fund sell a security, while not recommending such sale for other \\naccounts in order to enable the Fund to have sufficient liquidity to honour Shareholders' \\nredemption requests. When there is a limited supply of Investments, the Investment \\nManager will use its reasonable efforts to allocate or rotate investment opportunities, but \\nthe Inves tment Manager cannot assure absolute equality among all of its accounts and \\nclients.  \\n \\nvi. The Investment Manager, each of its affiliates and the Directors may engage in other \\nbusiness activities and manage the accounts of clients other than the Fund including those \\nof other collective investment vehicles. The investment strategy for such other clients may \\nvary from that of the Fund. The Investment Manager, each of its affiliates and the Directors \\nare not required to refrain from any other activity, nor must the y disgorge any profits from \\nany such activity, including acting as general partner, investment manager or managing \\nagent for investment vehicles with objectives similar to those of the Fund  \\n \\n2. Existing relationships . Enko  has long -term relationships with a significant number of companies \\nand their respective senior management. Enko also has relationships with numerous investors, \\nincluding institutional investors and their senior management. The existence and development of  \\nthese relationships may influence whether or not the Investment Manager undertakes a particular \\nInvestment on behalf of the Fund and, if so, the form and level of such Investment. Similarly, the \\nInvestment Manager may take the existence and development of  such relationships into \\nconsideration in its management of the Fund and its Investments.  \\n3. Incentive Fee . The Investment Manager's Incentive Fee may create an incentive for the \\nInvestment Manager to make investments that are riskier or more speculative than  would be the \\ncase in the absence of an Incentive Fee. However, this incentive may be tempered somewhat by \\nthe fact that losses will reduce the Fund’s performance and thus the Investment Manager’s \\ncompensation, and by the fact that such Investment Manager (and its key executives) has also \\nmade an investment in.  \\n4. Diverse Membership . The Shareholders may have conflicting investment, tax and other interests \\nwith respect to their Investments in the Fund. The conflicting interests of individual Shareholders \\nmay r elate to or arise from, among other things, the nature of the Investments made by the Fund, \\nthe structuring or the acquisition of Investments and the timing of disposal of Investments. As a\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': '/home/johan/Code/llm_rag_test/bin/data/duedil/EADF PPM Updated - June 2023.pdf', 'page': 77}, page_content='68 \\n consequence, conflicts of interest may arise in connection with th e decision made by the \\nInvestment Manager, including with respect to the nature or structuring of Investments, that may \\nbe more beneficial for one Shareholder than for another Shareholder, especially with respect to \\nShareholders’ individual tax situations.  In selecting and structuring Investments appropriate for \\nthe Fund, the Investment Manager will consider the Investment and tax objectives of the Fund and \\nits Shareholders as a whole, not of any Shareholder individually.  \\n5. Conflicts with Investments . Officer s and employees of the Investment Manager or its affiliates \\nwill serve as directors of certain Borrower Companies and, in that capacity, will be required to \\nexercise their fiduciary responsibility to make decisions that consider the best interests of such \\nrelated Investments and its investors. In certain circumstances, such as situations involving \\nbankruptcy or near insolvency of an Investment, actions that may be in the best interest of the \\nInvestment may not be in the best interests of the Fund, and vice versa. Accordingly, in these \\nsituations, there will be conflicts of interests between the individual’s duties as an officer or \\nemployee of the Investment Manager or its affiliates and such an individual’s duties as a director \\nof the Investment.  \\n6. Management of the Fund . Members of the Investment Manager’s team will devote such time to \\nthe Fund as the Investment Manager, in its sole discretion, deems necessary to carry out the \\noperations of the Fund effectively. A number of members of the Investment Manager’s team will \\nspend a significant portion of their time on matters unrelated to the Fund. As a result, conflicts of \\ninterests will arise in time allocation.  \\n7. Resolution of Conflicts. Any conflicts of interest that arise between the Fund, on the one hand, \\nand th e Investment Managers, their affiliates, any existing or future Enko -managed investment \\nvehicle on the other hand, will be discussed and resolved on a case by case basis by the relevant \\nparties, and in accordance with the Investment Manager’s conflict mana gement procedures \\nestablished in accordance with the applicable regulatory requirements in terms of which the \\nInvestment Manager is regulated. Any such discussion s and resolution plans will take into \\nconsideration the interests of the relevant parties and the circumstances giving rise to the conflict. \\nAll conflicts of interest involving the Fund, and the resolution plans thereof, will be reported to \\nthe Directors. In vestors should be aware that such conflicts will not necessarily be resolved in \\nfavour of the Fund’s interests. By acquiring Shares in the Fund, each Shareholder will be deemed \\nto have acknowledged the existence of any such actual or potential conflicts of  interest as detailed \\nin this section, and to have waived any claim with respect to any liability arising from the existence \\nof any such conflict.  \\n8. Fair treatment of shareholders. As a general  matter, the Directors owe certain fiduciary duties to \\nthe Compan y, which require them to, among other things, act in good faith and in what they \\nconsider to be in the best interests of the Company and in doing so, the Directors will act in a \\nmanner that ensures the fair treatment of Shareholders. In exercising their di scretions (including \\nin determining to cause the Company to enter into any side letters), the Directors will act in \\naccordance with such fiduciary duties. This requires them to ensure that their actions (including, \\nwithout limitation, in entering into side  letters) do not result in the unfair treatment of \\nShareholders. For the purposes of the FCA, the Investment Adviser is required to treat all \\nShareholders fairly.'),\n",
