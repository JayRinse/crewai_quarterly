This increase has resulted in the proliferation of lengthy, customized due diligence questionnaires (“DDQ”) \\nby many Limited Partners, advisors and placement agents. These customized DDQs, which have varying content and \\nlength, have created an extraordinary administrative burden on all interested parties, including Limited Partners, \\nGeneral Partners and Placement Agents.  \\n \\nAdditionally, to ensure they are cognizant of the industry’s best practices, LPs are attentive to the types of diligence \\nquestions their peers are asking. With few available forums dedicated to the sharing of diligence practices, some \\nLimited Partners may not even be aware of the level of detail being provided to their peers regarding a prospective \\nfund. \\n \\nThe search for a more efficient process, and a means of minimizing the administrative burden of fundraising on all \\nparties, prompted the ILPA to reach out to General Partners, Limited Partners, Placement Agents and other interested \\nparties to craft a DDQ tool that may offer those efficiencies. The resources used to create and process the customized, \\nbut often redundant, questions and responses could then be repurposed toward additional transparency, assessment \\nand analysis of results. \\n \\nThe ILPA Due Diligence Questionnaire (“ILPA DDQ”) was compiled from over a dozen sample questionnaires provided \\nby LPs, GPs and third parties. It has been reviewed by the members of the ILPA Research, Benchmarking & Standards \\nCommittee, as well as several industry leaders as part of a six-month, public comment period. \\n \\nPlease note that the ILPA DDQ is not intended to be a required document that all GPs must adopt. It is also not \\na panacea for all LPs’ diligence needs. We acknowledge that some variation may still be employed in the \\nindustry. The goal of this tool is to minimize variations to questions that are unique to a specific LP or GP. \\n \\nThe ILPA DDQ covers many topics related to fund diligence, including: \\n1. \\nGeneral Firm Information \\n2. \\nGeneral Fund Information \\n3. \\nInvestment Strategy \\n4. \\nInvestment Process \\n5. \\nTeam \\n6. \\nAlignment of Interest \\n7. \\nMarket Environment \\n8. \\nFund Terms \\n9.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

Adoption will make questionnaire stage more efficient by \\nminimizing the number of customized DDQs from LPs and consultants. \\n2. \\nIs the industry required to use this document? \\nNo, the ILPA understands that this document may not necessarily be applicable for all funds, or provide efficiencies \\nfor all parties. However, GPs that receive multiple questionnaires, with redundant and differently-organized \\nquestions, should see efficiencies in the diligence process.  \\n3. \\nHow should GPs with funds for different strategies/geographies/industries (e.g. separate venture and \\ngrowth funds) answer questions about the firm, and its funds and teams that aren’t currently fund raising? \\nWhat level of information is relevant to LPs if they are only conducting diligence on a specific type of fund \\noffered by a GP? \\nIn these situations, the GP does not necessarily need to provide detailed information about business units that are \\nmaterially unrelated to the Fund. (A simple overview of these non-related business units should be made available, \\nhowever.) Unless specifically noted, any reference to the “Firm” in the ILPA DDQ should be focused on business \\nunits materially related to the Fund. GP’s should clearly state the business units being included and be able to \\nexplain their rationale for excluding others. \\n4. \\nAre GP’s expected to provide answers to any “sensitive” questions in this document? \\nGP’s are not required to divulge sensitive information, especially if it violates any non-disclosure agreements with \\nother parties. It is also understood that GPs may need to use caution in providing information to organizations they \\nfeel are not genuinely interested in committing to their fund. However, as fiduciaries, Limited Partners should not \\nfeel restricted from asking sensitive questions. The GP’s right to guard confidential information is no greater than \\nthe LP’s right to inquire about information they feel is relevant to the transparency and alignment of their potential \\npartnership. If GPs are more comfortable with providing certain answers in person, in a redacted format or at a \\nlater stage in the diligence process, they should feel encouraged to do so.', mimetype='text/plain', start_char_idx=None, end_char_idx=None, text_template='{metadata_str}\\n\\n{content}', metadata_template='{key}: {value}', metadata_seperator='\\n'),\n",

However, they should also provide an \\nexplanation for their rationale, as well as any further direction for LPs, in this document. \\n5. \\nAre GPs expected to answer questions that are not applicable to their specific fund? \\nThe ILPA DDQ is an attempt at a comprehensive questionnaire that applies to the majority of private equity funds. \\nLPs should understand that not all questions are applicable to all GPs/funds. GPs should use their best judgment \\nto only answer questions that are relevant to their organization. For skipped questions in the Detailed Questions \\nsection, GPs should provide a brief, one sentence statement explaining their rationale for not answering. For the \\nskipped questions in the Basic Questions section, “N/A” should be populated in the “Reference” field.  \\n6. \\nShould LPs use a GP’s answers in the Basic Questions section (yes/no questions) as the sole criteria for \\ntheir ultimate investment decision? \\nNo, the basic questions are intended to provide LPs with a top-level checklist, and a framework to highlight issues \\nthat need further clarity. There may be extenuating circumstances that explain a particular “negative” answer. GPs \\nshould use the “Reference” field in the Basic Questions section to direct LPs to more expanded answers to these \\nquestions. LPs should review the expanded answers in the Detailed Questions section, as well as their own follow-\\nup questions, before making any investment decisions. \\n7. \\nShould LPs only use this document?
